# Eclipse Xtend

## Notice

The content of this repository (`xtext-xtend`) has been moved to the [Xtext Monorepo](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/). Please refer to that repository to find the code, create issues or file pull requests.

## About

[Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) is a flexible and expressive dialect of Java that compiles into readable Java source code. You can use any existing Java library seamlessly. The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast as the equivalent handwritten Java code. Become productive and write beautiful code with powerful macros, lambdas, operator overloading, and many more modern language features.

## How To Build

### Core Module

Check out and run `./gradlew build`.

Additional command line arguments:
 - `-PcompileXtend=true` activates the [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) compiler, but this is optional because the generated Java code is included in the repository.
 - `-PuseJenkinsSnapshots=true` switches to using the Maven repositories generated by the [Jenkins build jobs](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/) for [xtext-lib](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-lib), [xtext-core](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core), and [xtext-extras](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-extras). Without this argument, [Sonatype snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) are used.

### Maven Support

First run `./gradlew publish publishToMavenLocal` to compile and install the Xtend core module, then run
```
mvn -f maven-pom.xml clean install -PuseSonatypeSnapshots
```

With the above configuration, [Sonatype snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) are used for upstream Xtext dependencies. The alternative profile `-PuseJenkinsSnapshots` activates the Maven repositories generated on the [Jenkins server](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/) for [xtext-lib](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-lib), [xtext-core](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core), and [xtext-extras](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-extras) instead.

### Eclipse Support

Run `mvn -f tycho-pom.xml clean install`.

Note: The [target platform](releng/org.eclipse.xtend.target/org.eclipse.xtend.target-luna.target) used for the Tycho build loads the required Xtext dependencies ([xtext-lib](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-lib), [xtext-core](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core), [xtext-extras](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-extras)) from their respective p2 repositories on the [Jenkins server](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/).
